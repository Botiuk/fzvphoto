Personal blog app for my real personal blog facebook.com/fzvphoto with photography and text reports from sports events (mostly from amateur football).

My native language is Ukrainian and this is a single language on app. But all interface text was made with I18n and easy to change with translating locale file.

The blog was created in 2019 and needed a similar unique name for pages on social media. His full name is "Football from behind the gate and other photos" and in Ukraine language, it sounds "Futbol z-za vorit ta inshi foto" - that's why his short internet name is FZVphoto.

In app anybody can read text reports, look at the corresponding photographs, search posts, and albums connected with the current location, football team, stadium, or tournament.

The author can sign in and after that add and edit all content. This single user in devise is created through db:seed.
